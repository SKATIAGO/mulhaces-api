# Dental Clinic Scheduling API – Coding Exercise Skeleton

This repository is a **skeleton** for the coding exercise.

- The full exercise description is provided separately (PDF).
- You are free to modify the structure, add Laravel, and organize the code as you prefer,
  as long as you meet the functional and technical requirements.

## Suggested starting points

- Use Laravel 10+ with PHP 8.x.
- Use MariaDB as database.
- Provide a Docker-based setup (docker-compose + Dockerfile).
- Place your domain logic and framework-agnostic components where it makes more sense to you.

## Legacy file

There is a legacy file under `legacy/AppointmentPricing.php` that you must NOT edit directly.
You are expected to create a modern, object-oriented alternative and integrate it into your solution.
